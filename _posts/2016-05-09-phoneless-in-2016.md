description: "Lost my iPhone on Thursday night. No idea where it went. I have find my iPhone turned on, but the battery died. All they have to do is plug it into a charger, and it will notify my of it's location automatically, but no one has done that yet. Problem is, I don't want to activate a new SIM card until that happens, and in the mean time, I'm phoneless. Very surreal feeling. "
